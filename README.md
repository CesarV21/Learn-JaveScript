# My Progress in "Learn JavaScript"

## About This Course

Welcome to my repository where I will document my progress through the **Learn JavaScript** course. In this course, I will learn the fundamental concepts of programming using JavaScript syntax, which will enable me to apply JavaScript in any environment.

To learn more about the course, you can visit [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/introduction-to-javascript).

## What Will I Learn?

By the end of this course, I will be able to:

- Handle JavaScript data types, use built-in methods, and declare variables.
- Implement conditionals to control the flow of a program.
- Build functions and pass data through them efficiently.
- Differentiate between global and block-level scopes in JavaScript.
- Use arrays to store and manipulate lists of data.
- Implement loops to execute blocks of code repeatedly.
- Apply iterator methods to simplify iteration over arrays.
- Utilize modern ES6 object syntax to model real-world scenarios.

## Projects I Will Develop

Throughout the course, I will work on the following projects, applying the concepts learned:

1. **Kelvin Weather**  
   I will create a temperature converter to improve my use of variables and console output.

2. **Sleep Debt Calculator**  
   I will develop a calculator to determine if I am getting enough sleep each week, which will allow me to practice functions and separation of concerns.

3. **Whale Talk**  
   I will build a program that "talks like a whale," mastering the use of loops and string manipulation.
